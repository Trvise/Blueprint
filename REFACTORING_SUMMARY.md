- **Contains**: Component structure, JSX rendering, tab content
- **Responsibilities**: UI layout, tab rendering, prop passing

### 2. **CreateStepsHooks.js** (309 lines)
- **Purpose**: State management and side effects
- **Contains**: 
  - `useCreateStepsState()` - All state variables and refs
  - `useCreateStepsEffects()` - All useEffect hooks
- **Responsibilities**: State initialization, lifecycle management, keyboard shortcuts

### 3. **CreateStepsHandlers.js** (445 lines)
- **Purpose**: Event handlers and user interactions
- **Contains**: All onClick, onChange, and form submission handlers
- **Responsibilities**: Video selection, annotation handling, form management

### 4. **CreateStepsActions.js** (356 lines)
- **Purpose**: Step management and CRUD operations
- **Contains**: Step creation, editing, deletion, and project finalization

### 5. **CreateStepsStyles.js** (297 lines)
- **Purpose**: All component styling
- **Contains**: Style objects, responsive helpers
- **Responsibilities**: UI appearance, responsive design

### 6. **CreateStepsUtils.js** (67 lines)
- **Purpose**: Utility functions
- **Contains**: Time formatting, file upload, frame navigation

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Each file has a single, clear purpose
- Functions are easier to locate and modify
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### ✅ **Readability**
- Main component is now focused on structure and rendering
- Logic is organized by functionality
- Better code organization and discoverability

### ✅ **Testability**
- Individual functions can be unit tested in isolation
- Hooks can be tested separately from UI
- Clear separation of concerns enables better testing strategies

### ✅ **Reusability**
- Utility functions can be reused across other components
- Hooks can be shared with similar components
- Styles can be imported by related components

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- Faster file loading in editors
- Better IDE performance with smaller files
- Easier code navigation and search

## File Size Comparison

| File | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| CreateSteps.js | 1159 lines | 358 lines |
| **New Files** | | |
| CreateStepsHooks.js | - | 309 lines |
| CreateStepsHandlers.js | - | 445 lines |
| CreateStepsActions.js | - | 356 lines |
| CreateStepsStyles.js | - | 297 lines |
| CreateStepsUtils.js | - | 67 lines |
| **Total** | 1159 lines | 2232 lines* |

*\*Total increased due to better organization, imports, and documentation*

## Architecture Pattern

The refactoring follows a **modular component architecture**:

```
CreateSteps.js (Main Component)
├── CreateStepsHooks.js (State & Effects)
├── CreateStepsHandlers.js (Event Handlers)
├── CreateStepsActions.js (Business Logic)
├── CreateStepsStyles.js (Styling)
└── CreateStepsUtils.js (Utilities)
```

## Key Features Preserved

✅ **iMovie-like timeline interface**  
✅ **Vertical sidebar navigation**  
✅ **Step editing and management**  
✅ **Video annotation functionality**  
✅ **Tools and materials management**  
✅ **Project finalization workflow**  
✅ **File upload capabilities**  
✅ **Responsive design**  

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Centralized in `useCreateStepsState()` hook
- Clear separation of concerns by feature area
- Proper TypeScript-like organization with JSDoc comments

### Event Handling
- All handlers grouped by functionality
- Consistent parameter patterns
- Error handling and validation

### Side Effects
- Organized by purpose (initialization, video metadata, keyboard shortcuts)
- Proper dependency arrays
- Clean-up functions for all listeners

### Styling
- Centralized style objects
- Responsive helper functions
- Consistent design system

## Future Improvements

1. **TypeScript Migration**: Easy to add types to individual modules
2. **Testing**: Each module can have dedicated test files
3. **Performance**: Can implement React.memo for individual components
4. **Reusability**: Hooks and utilities can be moved to shared folders

## Backup
Original file backed up as `CreateSteps.backup.js` for safety.
